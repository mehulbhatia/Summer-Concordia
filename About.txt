1. ABOUT THE SOFTWARE
  --------------------
  --------------------

  This software has been developed in Concordia University, Montreal ,Canada, under the supervision of Dr Ali Nazemi. Dr Ali Nazemi is an Assistant Professor in 
  Building, Civil, and Environmental Engineering Department at Concordia University. 
  AlbertaRes had been developed in the months of May, June and July 2018, by one of Dr Nazemi's undergraduate student from Indian Institute of Technology
  Guwahati named Mr Mehul Bhatia. Mr Mehul Bhatia got a chance to work with Dr Ali Nazemi by the grace of Mitacs Globalink Canada, which brings top rated researchers from all over the 
  world, to work with the best of professors in Canada, and ultimately benifit the Canadian researchers and their research activities. AlbertaRes uses the simulation 
  data obtained from the Water Resource Management Model ( WRMM ), and presents it in a user-friendly and easily usable way. Inital analysis can be easily done using this
  software, by utilising the "Reservoir Graph" option and hence obtain relevant graphs as per the need of the user. Locations for these reservoirs has also been 
  added to the software, for the easy access of the user.
